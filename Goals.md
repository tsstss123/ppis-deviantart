# Goals #

  * Create a toolbox for feature extracting and classifying we can reuse:<br>
<blockquote>- clean reusable code</blockquote></li></ul>

<ul><li>Create a recommender system that can recommend a new picture given a gallery<br>
</li></ul>> - Use multiple features and classifiers, find the best classifiers per gallery or per type of gallery. A new picture can be classified given the best classifiers per class which have to give a measure of it belonging to that class.
> - Lots of experimentation on pure and combined features and pure and combined classifiers is needed.

  * Create visualization tools for visualizing high dimensional image feature data <br></li></ul>


<ul><li>Research questions:<br>
<blockquote>- What is the influence on the "class" of features on the recommendation performance(class being statistical or human inspired) <br>
- How can the rich data help us (network information) <br></blockquote></li></ul>

<h1>Features</h1>
<blockquote>- Edgeness<br>
- Color<br>
- Weibull<br>
- Saliency<br>
- Emotions<br></blockquote>

<h1>Classifiers</h1>
<blockquote>- SVM<br>
- K-Means<br>
