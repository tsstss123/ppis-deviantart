%\item More features, Including emotional features (color and texture)
We want to expand the features used to include emotion inspired features, such color weight, color activity and color heat as described in \cite{color_emotion1}. The inclusion of texture would give an even deeper emotional descriptor \cite{LucassenECCGIV2010}. We believe that the emotional impact of an artwork plays a significant role in the artistic creative process, and would therefore be a meaningfull extention to our current work. 
%\item More network information - Using the Core network as a basis for a new dataset (ongoing), More links, not only watchers (hierachy)
\subsubsection{more network- this header can later be removed}
We want to expand the network to include more than only "watcher-watching" connections. DeviantArt is a rich dataset from which we can also extract the "artist-artwork", "artwork-hierarchical class", "hierarchiecal taxonomy" -connections, as well as comments users make to artists and/or pictures. 
Since our current investigations have provided us with a managable set of core users for deviantArt, this group can guide us in dataset collection for future work. Relevant questions can be, how the hierarchical artwork classification relates to sub-networks in the core of artists producing artwork in a particular class. Another relevant question is if the network structure and artwork in the core is representative for the whole network. If we can identify different usage patterns of DeviantART, for instance 'hubs' which are artists who are not popular because of the artwork thei themselve produce. But because of the other artists they connect to versus original artists who are popular because of their own work.
