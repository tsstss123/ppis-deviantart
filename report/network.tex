\subsubsection{Previous work}
small world network
Eventhough dA presents a rich dataset interesting for the art, social web, and computer vision communities, research on this a dA dataset is low. In \cite{DaMasters} dA discussed in the context of evaluating a specific peer-review and critiquing application.
Flickr is a large online community based around pictures, it has some resemblance with the functionality of dA provides, though it is more tailored to photographers instead of visual artists. Favorite markings and their spread through Flickr has been described in \cite{cha2009measurement}. The structure of Flickr has been discussed from an evolutionary perspective, using time information to show how the network grows, from a macroscopic \cite{kumar2006structure} and microscopic perspective \cite{leskovec2008microscopic}.


\subsubsection{Proposed approach}
Three network models of particular relevance for this project are the small-world model \cite{watts1998collective} from Watts and Strogatz and the Erd\"{o}s-R\'{e}nyi model for random networks \cite{erdos1960evolution} and regular ring latices. Small-world networks inhabit the space between the regular networks or lattices and random networks. Many practical networks have been shown to have a small-world topology, such as the nternet, the power grid amd neural networks,  for some more examples see \cite{albert2002statistical}. Small world-networks have a high cluster coefficient and low characteristic path length, means that  whereas random networks have a low characteristic path and low cluster coefficient and lattices have high cluster coefficients but long characteristic path length.

Coloquially explained in terms of my social network, a large(close to 1 ) cluster coefficient means that many of my friends know each other. A low characteristic path length means that I am connected to anyone on the world through small friends-of-friends chains.

Formally, let $G=(V, E)$ be a graph, where $V$ is a set of vertices, and $E$ a set of edges between vertices in $V$, here $e_{ij}$ denotes the edge connecting $i$ and $j$.  The \textit{out-neighborhood} of $v_i$, $N_i^{out}:=\{v_j|e_{ij}\in E\}$, the \textit{in-neighborhood} $N_i^{in}:=\{v_j|e_{ji}\in E\}$. The \textit{neighborhood} of $v_i$, $N_i:=N_i^{out}\cup N_i^{in}$. The \textit{degree} of vertex $v_i$, $k_i:=|N_i|$ is the number of vertices in the neighborhood of $v_i$, this can similarly be defined for in and out neigborhoods. The directional clustering coefficient for $v_i$ with $k_i>1$ can now be defined as:
$$C_i :=\frac{|\{e_{jk}\}|}{k_i(k_i-1)},$$
where $v_j,v_k\in N_i$ and $e_{jk}\in E$, let $n=|V|$ denote the number vertices the \textit{directional clustering coefficient} for $G$ is defined as:
$$C_G:=\frac{\sum_{i\in V} C_i}{n}.$$
The \textit{characteristic path length} $L_G$ of graph $G$ is the average shortest path length between vertices in $G$. Land  $L_{Gij}$ denote the length of the shortest path between vertices $i$ and $j$. 
$$L_G:= \frac{\sum_{i\in V} \sum_{j \in V\setminus i}L_{Gij}}{n(n-1)}.$$ 
Note finding all shortest paths can be performed using the Floyd-Warshall algorithm which has $O(|V|^3)$ complexity\cite{Floyd}.

For networks where $n\gg k\gg ln(n) \gg1$, the ring lattice will have $L_{lattice}\approx\frac{n}{2k}$ and $C_{lattice}\approx\frac{3}{4}$.
A large random network  $ L_{random}\approx\frac{\ln(n)}{\ln(k)}$ and $C_{random}=\frac{k}{n}$. A network is considered small world when $L_G\approx L_{random}$ and $C_G \gg C_{random}$

To find the core of most connected vertices we use the corefind algorithm, showin in Algorithm \ref{alg:findcore}.This algorithm recursively removes all vertices of degree $x$ from the network, starting at $1$. If there are vertices left in the network we repeat this with $x+1$. Once an empty network is obtained the previous network is deemed the core, because recursively removing nodes of higher degree will inevitably lead to an empty network. The choice of the $degree(j)$ - standard, in-degree, out-degree,  or in+out-degree - facilitates in finding cores with different characteristics.
