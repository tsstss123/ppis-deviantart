We have proposed a toolkit that provides functionality to capture a dataset from the dA website and annotate the images with state of the art image features.
These image features are used to cluster images using different classifiers.
The visualization that is part of the toolkit is used to explore and analyze the dataset.

Experimental results show that artists can be separated from other artists using simple image features.
The maximum $F_1$-Measure for separating artists (0.8742) was achieved using a linear SVM classifier.
Some features provide better discriminative power between artists then other features.
