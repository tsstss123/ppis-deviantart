This report describes an explorative research into devianART. Different research fields have been touched such as network analysis, visual feature extraction, image classification and data visualization.
A toolkit has been implemented with the aim of helping researchers to easily explore and analyze the rich data that deviantART offers. It provides functionality to extract the data containing images from the devianART website, after which the images are annotated with different types of image features. These image features are used to label images using different classifiers. Classification experiments have shown that it is possible to discriminate artists, artworks and styes. Even more, the toolkit provides a visualization application that can be used to explore and analyze the dataset in an interactive way. Moreover, deviantART network have been analyzed and a first attempt has been made to combine online social networks with image analysis.
