#summary Davide's research log


== 09/06/2010==
    * Searched for ways to compare two different saliency maps. 
       * Read few papers talking about using binary classification and cross-validation to choose which feature are discriminant to a given dataset. The method is probably not useful for DevianArt where there are images completely different. 
    * *Important question*: is a saliency map giving enough information to discriminate images into categories?? 
   *  *Though*: a saliency map can be useful to understand what user likes, such as if he/she tends to have the subject of the image in the center or in an other position, or if the subject is usually close to the camera or far away from it.     At the same time if a user has few pictures and with different subjects in different locations/distances from the camera, saliency map can not be usuful to discriminate.

    * Worked with Sander about finding similarity between two images using their saliency maps. We used the 25 images downloaded yesterday (5 for every style). 
    * *Approaches tried*:
       * The subtraction of the saliency maps of two images. This subtraction assigns good similarity to images that have saliency points located in the same part of the image. The _results_ have shown that this idea, applied alone, is not discriminant to divide the images in styles. Tacking into account only the exact location of a saliency object is not enough, because the same object could appear in a different location of the image, or in a different scale/size.
       * The comparison of the distribution of the saliency in the images. Every saliency map can be seen as a vector of features, and counting them it is easy to create the histogram of the saliency map. Then it is easy to compare two histograms of two different saliency maps. The _results_ are again not really interesting. It discriminates images that have few saliency points from images that have a lot of them, but it is not useful to discriminate images into styles. 
       
    * *Ideas & Issue*:
       * Try also to define a circle of a certain radius around a saliency point/object of a map, and then see if the second image contain it two. In this way we consider the "shape" of the saliency point/object, but we loose the location information. 
       * Combine the previous three ideas (the two implemented and the circle one) to see if they discriminate better. But how? 



== 07/06/2010==
    * Downloaded 25 images from DevianArt. Images "represent" 5 different styles and each style has 5 images associated. 
    * Played with the toolbox with these new images. 
    * Tries: 
       * give different weights to color, intensity and orientations
       * iterate different times using IOR and see how the different maps changes
       * not tried yet different pyramid level

== 07/06/2010==
    * Installed and added the image processing toolbox to my Matlab 
    * Downloaded the Dirk Walther's implementation of Itti's model at: http://www.saliencytoolbox.net/  
    * Read the documentation about the toolbox 
    * Played with the toolbox for simple images that were already proposed

    * Attended the meeting with Albert
    * Discussed about image and feature representation

== 04/06/2010==
Read the paper: _"*Computational modeling of visual attention*"_ of Laurent Itti and Christo Kock. 
    * In the paper they present a general overview and some recent work on *computational models of focal visual attention*. _Five trends_ have emerged from the work: 
       * the perceptual saliency of stimuli critically depends on the surrounding context.
       * a unique saliency map that topographically encodes for stimulus perspicuity over the visual scene has proved to be an efficient an plausible bottom-up control strategy
       * Inhibition of return (IOR), that is the process by which the currently attended location is prevented from being attended again, is a crucial element of attentional deployment
       * attention and eye movements tightly interplay, posing computational challenges with respect to the coordinate system used to control attention
       * scene understanding and object recognition strongly constrain the selection of attended location. 
    * The paper was interesting but a bit to general and to much focused on the neurobiological understanding of visual attention.

Read the paper: _"*A Model of Saliency-Based Visual Attention for Rapid Scene Analysis*"_ of Laurent Itti, Christof Koch and Ernst Niebur.
    * The paper is quite interesting and explain really good the way they try to extract saliency locations from images. The process can be seen in the following image:

    * Even more they compare the _saliency maps_ with a _spatial frequency (SFC) maps_. Results shows that the first one is much more robust to addition of noise to the image than the second one that seems to be very weakly. 
    * Even if saliency maps are really robust to noise, they still get a bit confused in the noise (e.g. its color) directly conflict with the main feature of the target. 

== 03/06/2010==
    * Explored DevianArt webages. 
*Considerations/Ideas*: 
    * Some users save their pictures/photos in galleries and in every gallery explored all the images belong to the same "topic". Maybe it could be interesting to find a way to suggest galleries instead of suggesting single images. 
    * DevianArt has categories (not based on the styles). The user is free to put its images under the category he prefer and often some pictures seems to be misclassified. 
    * Some categories contain very similar images (because the style is the same one) 
    * A category called "Stock Images" (the ones with a commercial target) contains images of completely different topics. 

    * We could extract 4-5 categories describing 4-5 different styles and we could classify them.

    * Meeting about the project and tasks at Science Park
    * My task is the extraction of cognitive features 
    * Discussed some data-structure ideas with Bart
