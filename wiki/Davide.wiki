Read the paper: _"Computational modelling of visual attention"_ of Laurent Itti and Christo Kock. 
    * In the paper they present a general overview and some recent work on *computational models of focal visual attention*. _Five trends_ have emerged from the work: 
       * the perceptual saliency of stimuli critically depends on the surrounding context.
       * a unique saliency map that topographically encodes for stimulus conspicuity over the visual scene has proved to be an efficien an plausible bottom-up control strategy
       * Inhibition of return, that is the process by which the currently attended location is prevented from being attended again, is a crucial element of attentional deployment
       * attention and eye movements tightly interplay, posing computational challanges with respect to the coordinate system used to control attention
       * scene understanding and object recognition strongly constrain the selection of attended location.

    * Explored DevianArt wepages. 
*Considerations/Ideas*: 
    * Some users save their pictures/fotos in galleries and in every gallery explored all the images belong to the same "topic". Maybe it could be interesting to find a way to suggest galleries instead of suggesting single images. 
    * DevianArt has categories (not based on the styles). The user is free to put its images under the category he prefer and often some pictures seems to be misclassified. 
    * Some categories contain very similar images (because the style is the same one) 
    * A category called "Stock Images" (the ones with a commercial porpouse) contains images of completely different topics. 

    * We could extract 4-5 category describing 4-5 different styles and we could classify them.

    * Meeting about the project and tasks at Science Park
    * My task is the extraction of cognitive features 
    * Discussed some data-structure ideas with Bart
