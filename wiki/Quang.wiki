#summary Research Log of Quang

=Research Log=

==11/06==
 * Organized all the .m files, it was getting a bit unclear. 
 * Currently trying to create a workflow through matlab code but there are a lot of parameters.

==10/06==
 * Created code to run a PRTools dataset format on different classifiers and outputted the scores, this helps in selecting what classifier performs the overall best. Also the function can be used for training a classifier to be used for classifying a new image.
 * PRTools also contains tools for finding the best feature on a dataset this might be handy in the future.

==09/06==

 * Implemented code to convert data to PRTools dataset format and use it for KNN.
 * Implemented code that given the features names return a dataset containing only those feature values. (Extension needed to extract only images we want but will need the information of the SQL database to know which images)  

==08/06==
 * Created code to classify a new image given the trained SVM classifier.
 * Created code to compute the similarity between users, now we have a ranking of which users are similar to the given user based on the features(for now hsv). Similarity measure was done using Euclidian distance on the gallery level(one vector representing all images of an user). User set are 8 different users, can be found in the Downloads section.

 * Created a basis for dividing a dataset into train and test set in order to evaluate and structured the scores using Matlabs classperf function. So now you can get the error rate using the code. Also made it so that you can just train the classifier.
 * The basis can be reused just changing the classifiers. 

==06/06==
 * Read the PRTools documentation to have a better understanding of it in order to utilize better.

==04/06==
 * Written code to read in a vector with feature values and use it in SVM. Also did this for kmeans. 
 * Written the code to create simple features like the average hue, saturation and intensity.
 * Note: We are going to run experiments so an extra addition to the code is to let it automatically output all statistics.

==03/06==
 * Looked for papers for Image classification. Found a very interesting survey paper containing all kinds of classification methods used in the literature. Also contains lots of information about how the research field has extracted different kinds of image features: http://isu.indstate.edu/qweng/classification_review_IJRS_2007.pdf

==02/06==
 * Had initial meeting about the project and tasks at Science Park
 * Started on SVM Classifier.
