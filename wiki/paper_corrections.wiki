III. Image Analysis
	colour -> italics <br>
	composition -> italics <br>
	contrast -> italics <br>
	image entropy -> italics <br>
	within- category -> withincategory <br>
	statistical features -> italics <br>

1) Statistical features
	color-based -> italics <br>
	mea- sure -> measure

2) Cognitively-inspired features
	decom posed -> decomposed <br>
	Shannon entropy -> italics <br>
	Standard deviation -> italics <br>
	Location -> italics <br>
	Skin intensity -> italics <br>
	Toolbox3 -> Toolbox
	
IV. Automatic Feature Selection
	How- ever -> However <br>
	Naive Bayes -> italics <br>
	Nearest Mean -> italics <br>
	Support Vector Machine -> italics <br>
	un-necessary -> unnecessary <br>
	inter-intra distance -> italics <br>

	formula of inter-intra has S_1^2 which we do not want <br>

	fn/tn/fp/tp table has a cutoff at the upper part of the table, should be properly placed <br>

	the symbols fn/tn/fp/tp in the formula must be italics <br>

	LibSVM6 -> LibSVM <br>
	Processing API ^7^ -> Processing API^7^
	(what i mean here is remove the whitespace character between API and ^7^)
