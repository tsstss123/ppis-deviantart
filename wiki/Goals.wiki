#summary What we are trying to achieve

= Goals =

 * Create a toolbox for feature extracting and classifying we can reuse:<br>
  - clean reusable code

 * Create a recommender system that can recommend a new picture given a gallery<br>
 - Use multiple features and classifiers, find the best classifiers per gallery or per type of gallery. A new picture can be classified given the best classifiers per class which have to give a measure of it belonging to that class.
 - Lots of experimentation on pure and combined features and pure and combined classifiers is needed.

 * Create visualization tools for visualizing high dimensional image feature data <br>


 * Research questions:
  - What is the influence on the "class" of features on the recommendation performance(class being statistical or human inspired) <br>
  - How can the rich data help us (network information) <br>
 
= Features = 
 - Edgeness<br>
 - Color<br>
 - Weibull<br>
 - Saliency<br>
 - Emotions<br>

= Classifiers = 
 - SVM<br>
 - K-Means<br>
