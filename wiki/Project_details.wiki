= Groups =

*Group 1*
Group one will focus on the classification based on statistical features.

  * Bart van de Poel (features)
  * Quang (classifiers)
  * Nick (visualization)

*Group 2*
Group two will focus on the classification based on cognitive features.

  * Sander (features)
  * Bart Buter (Scraping & social network)
  * Davide (features)

= Research questions =

*Global questions:*
  * Can we use image features to recommend deviants for a given gallery?
  * Can we use those features to cluster (classifier) the images into categories/styles? Given the taxonomy, are there features in our feature vector that can be used to classify these categories?

  * can we improve recommendation accuracy by incorporating the [friends] network?

  * which features are better? cognitive vs statistical recommendations

- metrics

  - use favorites as a metric 100 images of artist as train, 100 images including 10 of his favorites as test set.

  - use favorites as a metric 100 images of artist as train, 100 images including 10 of his own work not in the train set.

  - correlation between network distance and "image distance"
 

what are we recommending

recommending one image per gallery

see if it performs on a favorites gallery
