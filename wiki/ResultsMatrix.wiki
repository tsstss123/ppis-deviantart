I have uploaded the results, there are 3 files in the zip corresponding to the rowcolumn names, fmeasure resultmatrix and the feature combinations associated with the resultmatrix.

Both the fmeasure and feature combinations are stored in 6 different matrices.

 * Matrix1: results with all features
 * Matrix2: results with top 1 (int-int) feature
 * Matrix3: results with top 2 (int-int) features
 * Matrix4: results with top 3 (int-int) features
 * Matrix5: results with top 4 (int-int) features
 * Matrix6: results with top 5 (int-int) features

Any suggestions on how to pretty print it or some functions to extract interesting info out of it would be helpful. Also can anyone edit this page and make the text more readable I don't know the syntax
