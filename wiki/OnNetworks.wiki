#Info about networks

= Introduction =

there are multiple network models, from the paper references given I looked into:<br>
<br><a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s%E2%80%93R%C3%A9nyi_model>Erdős–Rényi model</a><br> 
- This does not seem to fit because of "random network connections", the clustering for these networks will probably be low
<br><a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barab%C3%A1si%E2%80%93Albert_model><br>
- Barabási–Albert model</a> This is a generative scale-free model, which might fit if our network is scale free, which we can discover by looking if the degree distribution follows the power law 
<br><a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watts_and_Strogatz_model>Watts and Strogatz model</a><br> 
- Also Small world network, has both local clustering as well as short characteristic paths


Conclusion once we have the network we should look at: <br>
- the degree distribution,<br>
- the cluster coefficients and<br>
- the average path length. <br>
these should be possible to cumpute using Pajek

Then we can decide which model fits and hopefully draw conclusions from that

Some basic statistics:
Number of Nodes: 103663 <br>
Number of Links: 4483023 <br>
Average Node Degree: 43.25 <br>
Fraction of reciprocal links: 17.65% <br>
Average Clustering Coefficient: 0.087% <br>

max recursive out degree 44, 1471 nodes <br>
max recursive in degree 43, 1701 nodes <br>
