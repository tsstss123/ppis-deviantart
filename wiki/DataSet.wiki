#summary Dataset information

== General information ==
The dataset can be downloaded using scraper/scraper_gallery.py.
As arguments it takes the usernames of the deviants we want to download

Example:
./scraper_gallery.py omega300m vyrl

The images are downloaded to the images folder. For each deviant a folder is created. The folder contains for each image a xml file with the category information. It also contains another 3 folders with the full sizes images and thumbtail images.

Example xml file (should be readable in matlab):

{{{
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!-- Written on 2010-06-15 13:10:50.043530 using Sanders awesome xml thing -->
<root xml_tb_version="3.1" idx="1" type="struct" size="1 1">
	<category idx="1" type="char" size="1 33">digitalart/paintings/people/pinup</category>
</root>
}}}


== Todo ==
For which users should we download the images?
