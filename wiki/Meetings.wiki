*BJ's notes

-copy blackboard discussions into wiki
-features we discussed: color, hue(median, mean), edge ratio, faces, saliency, weibull, emotions


= Meeting 07/06/2010 = 
*BJ's notes

-Watch out with metric vs measure, measure is safer, as the comment below also says<br>
-Look at literature firefly recommender systems, as well as LastFM & Pandora<br>
-Make the code so it can be :<br>
 - re-used as a "personal" toolbox <br>
 - make nice code <br>
 - make code that works on millions of images thus: <br>
  -- use openCV because it's quick <br>
  -- use profiler to see where mos of the time is lost <br>
-We can use classifiers as a distance measure as explained with the HMM's<br>
-Some saliency stuff was discussed with Davide<br>
-Some network stuff with BJ<br>
-Stock images are difficult but might be a nice expansion.<br>

*Global questions:*
  * Can we use image features to recommend deviants for a given gallery?
  * Can we use those features to cluster (classifier) the images into categories/styles? Given the taxonomy, are there features in our feature vector that can be used to classify these categories?

  * can we improve recommendation accuracy by incorporating the [friends] network?

  * which features are better? cognitive vs statistical recommendations

- measures

  - use favorites as a metric 100 images of artist as train, 100 images including 10 of his favorites as test set.

  - use favorites as a metric 100 images of artist as train, 100 images including 10 of his own work not in the train set.

  - correlation between network distance and "image distance"
 

what are we recommending

recommending one image per gallery

see if it performs on a favorites gallery
