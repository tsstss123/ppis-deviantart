  * Group discussion to divide the work
  * Installed processing using a Mac .dmg.
  * Installed Eclipse. Added a new project with the Processing lib. Now i'm able to program processing application in Eclipse SDK.
  * Explored a couple visualization frameworks/websites:

    * http://prefuse.org/gallery/
    * http://www.wikiviz.org/wiki/Tools
  * Downloaded the JAR and source code of Mondrian. Can't compile the source code, but JAR runs.
  * Downloaded Prefuse. I think this toolkit is more appropriate for our project then Processing. I contains several plot functions.
