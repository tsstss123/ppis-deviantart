Finished scraper now stores relevant data and stores intermediates these every 5 minutes
Started a run Sunday evening<br>

= Mo 7-6-2010 = 
Looked at results from 2 hr run in Pajek total nodes about 40.000, maximum in degree 3, about 600 nodes with an out degree of at least one, nodes with out degree of 0 have been visited and have no watchers, or have not been visited. <br>

= Tu 8-6-2010 =
Fixed network scraper, made it less disk intensive, now automatically reads in partial results and continues, spend time researching why -az.deviantart.com does not work on unix. this is because it's an illegal url. on windows it does work. <br>
Running scraper again <br>
researched networks <br>
DONE wiki on networks, meeting and goals

= We 9-6-2010 =
Looked at previous mean-shift tracker code, if there is anything useful in there, its colorspaces, histograms and histogram distance. <br>
Refamiliarized with matlab <br>
Made matlab feature extractor and image reader <br>
implemented Weibull <br>
GMailinglist since blackboard takes a day to mail. <br> 

= Th 10-06-2010 =
Nothing worth noting

= Fri 11-06-2010 = 
Meeting + notes in wiki

More wiki notes of meeting

= Sun 13-06-2010 = 
Network crawling finished

= Mon 14-06-2010 = 
Mostly football and some research into networks and weibull

= Tue 15-06-2010 =
Called group meeting to integrate all the islands and discuss experiments
Started network analysis in matlab Pajek cant handle nets this big
Lev Meeting
evening worked on having our files transformed for use with networking toolkit

= Wed 16-06-2010 =
helped think about classifier and integration <br>
more input into networking toolkit <br>
starting analysis in networking toolkit <br>
helped with saliency features <br>

= Thu 17-06-2010 =
Code cleanup <br>
weird matlab crash and cmd window: should be fixed with KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=True as enviroment variable . <br>
more code cleanup <br>
more network analysis <br>
helped with saliency feature extraction integration <br>
helped with classify <br>

looked at this for networks <br>
Self-emergence of knowledge trees: Extraction of the Wikipedia hierarchies <br>

= Fri 18-06-2010 = 
Helped Quan n Nick, generakl trouble shooting  <br>
Had meeting about report and why we do what experiments <br>
1st version of LDA, PCA code <br>

= Sat 19-06-2010 = 
improved LDA, PCA code
troubleshooting Weibull, te veel absoluut 0 geeft problemen met NaN, im(im==0)=eps; is de oplossing <br>

= todo = 
better understand Weibull & Networks
