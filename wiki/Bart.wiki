#summary BJ's log

= Bart's Log =

= We 2-6-2010 =
Discussed some data-structure ideas with Davide <br>
Discussed network links, favorites vs. viewers <br>

= Th 3-6-2010 =
Installing work enviroment on my computer, matlab python svn etc.<br>
Researching network links  <br>
trying out scrapy for python,<br>
needs, python2.6, zope.interface, twisted10,  pywin, libxml2, lxml,<br>
http://users.skynet.be/sbi/libxml-python/<br>

= Fri 4-6-2010 =
Group meeting took notes <br>
Made scraper with Sander, does not store correct data bur crawls along the relevant images <br>

= Weekend = 
Finished scraper now stores relevant data and stores intermediates these every 5 minutes
Started a run Sunday evening<br>

= Mo 7-6-2010 = 
Looked at results from 2 hr run in Pajek total nodes about 40.000, maximum in degree 3, about 600 nodes with an out degree of at least one, nodes with out degree of 0 have been visited and have no watchers, or have not been visited. <br>

= Tu 8-6-2010 =
Fixed network scraper, made it less disk intensive, now automatically reads in partial results and continues, spend time researching why -az.deviantart.com does not work on unix. this is because it's an illegal url. on windows it does work. <br>
Running scraper again <br>
researched networks <br>
DONE wiki on networks, meeting and goals

= We 9-6-2010 =
Looked at previous mean-shift tracker code, if there is anything useful in there, its colorspaces, histograms and histogram distance. <br>
Refamiliarized with matlab <br>
Made matlab feature extractor and image reader <br>
implemented Weibull <br>
GMailinglist since blackboard takes a day to mail. <br> 

= Th 10-06-2010 =
Nothing worth noting

= Fri 11-06-2010 = 
Meeting + notes in wiki

= Sat 12-06-2010 = 
More wiki notes of meeting

= Sun 13-06-2010 = 
Network crawling finished

= Mon 14-06-2010 = 
Mostly football and some research into networks and weibull

= Tue 15-06-2010 =
Called group meeting to integrate all the islands and discuss experiments
Started network analysis in matlab Pajek cant handle nets this big
Lev Meeting
evening worked on having our files transformed for use with networking toolkit

= Wed 16-06-2010 =
helped think about classifier and integration <br>
more input into networking toolkit <br>
starting analysis in networking toolkit <br>
helped with saliency features <br>

= Thu 17-06-2010 =
Code cleanup <br>
weird matlab crash and cmd window: should be fixed with KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=True as enviroment variable . <br>
more code cleanup <br>
more network analysis <br>
helped with saliency feature extraction integration <br>
helped with classify <br>

looked at this for networks <br>
Self-emergence of knowledge trees: Extraction of the Wikipedia hierarchies <br>

= Fri 18-06-2010 = 
Helped Quan n Nick, generakl trouble shooting  <br>
Had meeting about report and why we do what experiments <br>
1st version of LDA, PCA code <br>

= Sat 19-06-2010 = 
improved LDA, PCA code
troubleshooting Weibull, te veel absoluut 0 geeft problemen met NaN, im(im==0)=eps; is de oplossing <br>

= Mon 20-06-2010 =
Pca, lda onm big dataset <br>
Meeting <br>
Literature on Networks google search on, "social networks" "online social netwoks" + art + artist + flickr.

= Tue 21-06-2010 =
made slides on network, pca, networks slides.
Literature in Bibtex on Weibull
investigated more into core network

= Wed 22-06-2010 = 
Pre-presentation work
Presentation
Debug of network scraper code Oops

= Thu 23-06-2010 = 
big report meeting
read literature
wrote average image function to show dataset in report

= Fri 24-06-2010 = 
Wrote Weibull, <br> 
Wrote Future work <br>
Wrote Previous work, working through network references <br>

= Sat 25-06-2010 =
sick

= Sun 26-06-2010 = 
Studied & wrote networks section<br>
and Appendix

= Mon 27-06-2010 = 
wrote networks experiments
rewrote introduction

= Tue 28-06-2010 = 
Edited whole paper together
Wrote conclusion
