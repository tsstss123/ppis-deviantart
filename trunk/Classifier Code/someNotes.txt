- Recommender System
	- General feature vector of user or set of images
	- Compare with other images features
	
- Classify Image with a trained Classifier
	- Current Class
	- Other Classes
	
	Compute similarity:
		- mahalauobis distance
		- or with normalization
	
	Normalization methods (important)
		- x - mean / stddev
		- x - (xmin /xmax)
		- can do +- .5 for some classifiers
		
	CR curve for verifying
	
	Compute for all or alot of classifiers for big range parameters
	and only show the best results
	
	ROC Curve for results
