\textbf{[about deviantART] Nick}
\\
deviantART\footnote{\url{http://www.deviantart.com}} (commonly abbreviated as \textit{dA}) is the largest online community [?] showcasing various forms of user-made artwork.
The website was launched in 2000 and has over 13 million registered members.
The platform allows emerging and established artists to exhibit, promote, and share their works within a peer community dedicated to the arts.
Newly added art is submitted to the constantly-changing \textit{Newest} listing, where it is viewable by the general public. 
Members are able to create profiles, galleries of their own work, and to choose \textit{Favorites} from among other submissions.
Through the publicity process, some pieces become \textit{Popular}, and are added to a ranked list of \textit{Most Popular} in the last 8 hours, 1 day, 3 days, 1 week, 1 month, and \textit{All time}.
During their browsing, members are also allowed to comment on one another’s art and on their profiles, making for a highly interactive and dynamic community.
All artwork is organized in a comprehensive category structure, including traditional media, such as painting and sculpture, to digital art, pixel art, films and anime.


\textbf{[about image features] Bart P.}
\\
When working with images, it is usually not possible to work with the raw image data (the pixel values). The reason for this is the high dimensionality of images, which can easily exist in a space of more than a million dimensions. By extracting features from images, they can be represented in a lower dimensional feature-space.  This feature extraction process has several advantages:
\begin{itemize}
\item The data becomes computationally easier to work with due to the smaller number of dimensions
\item By using the right features, the data becomes more suitable for generalization across images
\item Reducing the dimensionality makes it easier to visualize sets of images
\item Features can have an intuitive basis, which makes it easier for non-computer-scientists to analyze (sets of) images
\end{itemize}
\textit{Here something general about different kinds of image features}
