 note                 = {Apparently, the Weibull parameters form a six-stimulus basis for stochastic texture description. The results indicate that texture perception can be approached like the experimental science of colorimetry.We have experimentally verified that the Weibull distribution characterizes spatial statistics for ergodic stochastic textures.},

 booktitle            = {International Workshop on Texture Analysis and Synthesis},
 note                 = {Observations  on 45,000 stock photos of natural images, covering a wide variety of topics, revealed that 60% of all images have strict Weibull-shaped contrast distributions. The remaining percentage of images has a distribution close to Weibull or is highly regular. These images are typically composed of two (or more) parts in the image, each having a distinct Weibull contrast distribution. },
