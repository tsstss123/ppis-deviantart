% General structure: galleries. Features page. "Sub galleries".
%                    Friends: deviants you watch, but they don't neccessarily watch you.
%                    Different users: Premium and free (and a bunch of other type of members: banned, staff, whatever).
% No api to easily extract images
% rss xml files provided, making it reasonable easy 
% to extract image info and download the different images
% Image formats. Thumbnails.
DeviantArt provides users, also called deviants, galleries of their images. 
When someone visits such a gallery a featured page will be shown. Furthermore
the user is provided with options to browse the gallery or visit a sub gallery
defined by the user.

DeviantArt does not provide a web api to download images. This makes it more 
difficult to download images and changes to the website can possible break
down the downloading application.

DeviantArt does provide rss, which allows us to download xml files containing 
information about the users galleries. RSS xml files are more easy to parse
than the html gallery pages.

For each image the full sized image and two different sized thumbnails are 
available. DeviantArt supports png, jpeg, bmp and gif image formats.

\subsection{Features}
In the extraction of image features, a distinction was made between low-level statistical features and higher level cognitive-based features....

\subsubsection{Statistical features}
As statistical features, many relatively simple low-level features were extracted from the images. Below is a list of all features and their meaning:
\begin{itemize}
\item Edge ratio: description
\item Corner ratio: description
\item etc...
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Cognitive features}
