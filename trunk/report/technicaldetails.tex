\subsection{Features}
In the extraction of image features, a distinction was made between low-level statistical features and higher level cognitive-based features....

\subsubsection{Statistical features}
As statistical features, many relatively simple low-level features were extracted from the images. Below is a list of all features and their meaning:
\begin{itemize}
\item Edge ratio: description
\item Corner ratio: description
\item etc...
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Cognitive features}
