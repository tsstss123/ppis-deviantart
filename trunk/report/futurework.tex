The toolkit we have proposed is offering the elementary components to perform experiments on dA.
By extending the functionalities of this toolkit, many more interesting experiments can be conducted.

We would like to expand the collected network to include more than only \textit{watcher-watching} connections, for example \textit{hierarchiecal taxonomy} connections.
%, as well as comments users make to artists and/or pictures. 
%Since our current investigations have provided us with a manageable set of core users for deviantArt, this group can guide us in dataset collection for future work.
Relevant questions can be, how the hierarchical artwork classification relates to sub-networks in the core of artists producing artwork in a particular class.
Another relevant question is if the network structure and artwork in the core is representative for the whole network.
%If we can identify different usage patterns of deviantART, for instance hubs which are artists who are not popular because of the artwork they themselves produce.
%But because of the other artists they connect to versus original artists who are popular because of their own work.

It would be interesting to increase the number of extracted features, especially features that are based on the analysis of human perception.
The emotional impact of an artwork plays a significant role in the artistic creative process, and therefore the extraction of emotion-inspired features, such as color weight, color activity and color heat \cite{color_emotion1} could help the classifier to better distinguish between classes.
Moreover, the inclusion of texture would give an even deeper emotional descriptor~\cite{LucassenECCGIV2010}.

Incorporating time into the toolkit would be a great addition, allowing experiments to investigate changes in art over time.

The visualization currently lacks advanced interactions to reduces clutter.
We would like to incorporate more advanced interactions like zooming and dynamic scaling.
Furthermore, we would like to add automated communication between the visualization and the other components of the toolkit.
This allows you to dynamically expand the dataset by performing an action in the visualization application.
Communication between the visualization and the classifier can be used to integrate classification inside the visualization application, allowing classifications without requiring technical knowledge.
This allows more powerful methods to find patterns (e.g. clusters) in the dataset.
