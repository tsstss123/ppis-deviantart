This report describes an explorative research into deviantART. Different research fields have been touched such as network analysis, visual feature extraction, image classification and data visualization.
A toolkit has been implemented with the aim of helping researchers to easily explore and analyze the rich data that deviantART offers. It provides functionality to extract data containing images from the devianART website, after which the images are annotated with different types of image features. These image features are used to classify images using different classifiers. Classification experiments have shown that it is possible to discriminate artists, artworks and styles. Furthermore, the toolkit provides a visualization application that can be used to explore and analyze the dataset in an interactive way. Finally, the deviantART network has been analyzed. This is the first attempt to combine online social networks with image analysis.
