# What are we doing, goals #

- make tools & explore for master project
- Amila & Lev, social network and art analysis
- combine features that work well

feater extract, we have investigated features to see which work.
why did we choose them our intuition
how do they preform.
conclusion: which ones do we recommend, combine using visual tool
interpretable features

classification:
- show that things are classifyable
- show waht features perform well or bad on our experiment
- classify by person
- maybe later per hierarchy, code should be able to do it
